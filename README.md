# etch-a-sketch

This contains the code for the Etch-A-Sketch exercise from The Odin Project curriculum.

Used the following to create this:

1. Used a loop to create multiple divs that will serve as the cells inside the grid.
2. Also added event listeners to the divs for when the user mouse over them to change their color.
3. Created a function to modify CSS rules so that the cell size is recalculated to always use all the space in the container.
